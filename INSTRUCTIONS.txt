ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN DIAGNOSTIC SCRIPTS

=== STEP 1: Open Command Prompt ===
1. Press Windows key + R
2. Type: cmd
3. Press Enter

=== STEP 2: Navigate to project folder ===
Copy and paste this command:
cd C:\unison

=== STEP 3: Run the shortcut analyzer ===
Copy and paste this command:
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "analyze-phone-link-shortcut.ps1"

This will show us:
- Where Phone Link is actually installed
- What DLLs it uses
- Registry settings
- Package information

=== STEP 4: Run the automation checker ===
Copy and paste this command:
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "check-automation-logs.ps1"

This will show us:
- If our Send button detection works
- Why the button might be disabled
- If we can click it properly

=== STEP 5: Copy ALL the output ===
1. Right-click in the command prompt window
2. Choose "Select All"
3. Press Enter to copy
4. Paste it in your next message

=== WHAT THIS WILL REVEAL ===
- The exact Phone Link executable path
- Available DLLs we can use to send messages
- Authentication tokens stored locally
- Why our current automation isn't working

This will help us either:
A) Fix the UI automation approach, OR
B) Switch to calling Phone Link's DLLs directly

ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Make sure Phone Link is OPEN when running these scripts!
